# [Patient Time][0]

Devoted to my twinned obsessions (not entirely voluntary but nonetheless sincere) with medicine (particularly the experience of being a patient) and time. As with much in my writing and thinking, some of this is filtered through comics, especially insofar as the blog will ultimately be a sketchbook for thinking through a book on the subject (which will bear the same name). But most of the hardcore comics stuff will be over at guttergeek, and here I will share personal experiences, thoughts on current books on the subject(s), semi-articulate polemics about current policies and practices, and archival divings into the history of medicine.
