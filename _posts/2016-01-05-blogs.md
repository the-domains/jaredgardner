# _[Patient Time][0]_

Devoted to my twinned obsessions (not entirely voluntary but nonetheless sincere) with medicine (particularly the experience of being a patient) and time. As with much in my writing and thinking, some of this is filtered through comics, especially insofar as the blog will ultimately be a sketchbook for thinking through a book on the subject (which will bear the same name). But most of the hardcore comics stuff will be over at guttergeek, and here I will share personal experiences, thoughts on current books on the subject(s), semi-articulate polemics about current policies and practices, and archival divings into the history of medicine.

# _[Guttergeek][1]_

For a good part of the last decade this was a review blog, usually collaborative, focused on all things comics. There was a stretch where we were incorporated into the _Comics Journal _and a stretch after that when we rebranded as The Panelists (much of that site sadly lost when the band broke up). But mostly it was me and my partner-in-crime Alex Boney trying to keep writing about comics until everything made sense. Now it is just me, minding a shop that hasn't had many wares in the last year or two. I plan on bringing it back into action in the months ahead, less as a straight up comics review blog and more as a place for me to talk out loud about comics and pop culture in general.
